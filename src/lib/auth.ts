// This file was previously used for MSAL configuration.
// Since MSAL has been removed and we are using a custom mock authentication,
// this file is no longer needed for MSAL specific configurations.
// Authentication logic is now primarily in src/components/auth/AppProviders.tsx
// and API route protection in src/middleware.ts.

// If you need to centralize any constants or helper functions for your
// custom mock authentication that are shared between client and server (middleware),
// this could be a place for them. For now, it's empty.
